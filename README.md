# Data_Migration_Azure
A data migration project involves transferring data from one system, format, or storage location to another. This process is often undertaken when organizations upgrade systems, consolidate data, move to the cloud, or modernize legacy infrastructure. 
•	Migrated structured data from on-premise SQL Server (SSMS) to Azure Data Lake & Synapse for cloud modernization.
•	Analysed business and technical requirements, mapping documents, and transformation rules for accurate migration.
•	Created & executed ETL test cases to validate extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
•	Performed source-to-target reconciliation (row count, duplicates, constraints, metadata validation) ensuring 100% accuracy.
•	Automated backend validation using SQL & Python scripts, reducing manual effort.
•	Validated Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines for full load and incremental load scenarios.
•	Collaborated with developers, BAs, and data engineers to resolve migration defects and retest fixes.
•	Tested & verified BI reports in Power BI, ensuring correct KPIs and business insights post-migration.
